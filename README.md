OpenVPN Client adapted for use on the Cloudron platform

Instructions: Please add your own .ovpn personal file (convert it to `vpn.conf` and add the line `dev-node /app/code/net-tun`) to the root directory before installing it to Cloudron. It will connect to that .ovpn file upon startup. I will be writing a web interface to allow you to change .ovpn files on demand (through an API endpoint **and** a complete easy-to-use web interface. Those two methods will automatically add the `dev-node /app/code/net-tun` and rename your `.ovpn` file to `vpn.conf`, but for now that has to be done manually. You can also do this in the Cloudron File Manager whenever you want and restart the app and it will connect whatever `vpn.conf` file you put in there.
